          design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots are used in
          various industries for tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, or
          require high precision, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and space
          exploration.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Computer Vision is a subset of AI that enables machines to interpret
          and make decisions based on visual data from the world. It is used in
          applications such as facial recognition, object detection, and
          autonomous vehicles.
