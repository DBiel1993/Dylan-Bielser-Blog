        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Definition and Basic Concept of Deep Learning</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with many layers to analyze various types of data. The fundamental concept of deep learning is to enable a machine to mimic the human brain's ability to process information and learn from experience. Deep learning models can automatically extract features from raw data, significantly reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          While both machine learning and deep learning fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence, there are key differences between the two. Traditional machine learning models often require manual feature extraction and selection, whereas deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Deep learning models, especially those utilizing deep neural networks, typically require larger datasets and greater computational power compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

        <h2>Neural Networks</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Structure and Function</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process input data to generate an output. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which is adjusted during training to minimize the error in the model's predictions. The basic structure includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Types of Neural Networks (Convolutional, Recurrent)</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Primarily used for image and video recognition, CNNs leverage convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Suitable for sequential data, such as time series or natural language, RNNs maintain a memory of previous inputs in their internal state, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies.

        <h2>Training Deep Learning Models</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Before training a deep learning model, the data must be preprocessed. This includes tasks such as normalization, data augmentation, and handling missing values. Proper preprocessing is crucial for improving the model's performance and generalizability.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Backpropagation and Optimization</h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons. During backpropagation, the model calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and updates the weights using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
