    <h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Despite its potential, the integration of AI into business operations and strategy comes with several challenges and ethical considerations. Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount, as AI systems often handle vast amounts of sensitive information. Businesses must implement robust data protection measures to prevent breaches and maintain customer trust.
