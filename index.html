                Machine learning (ML) is a crucial subset of artificial
                intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and
                make decisions without explicit programming. Rooted in the 1950s
                with significant milestones such as the development of neural
                networks, ML has revolutionized various fields through
                supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Key
                algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support
                vector machines, and neural networks.
