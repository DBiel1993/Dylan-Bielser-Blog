          <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning (ML) is a crucial subset of artificial intelligence
            (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions
            without explicit programming. Rooted in the 1950s with significant
            milestones such as the development of neural networks, ML has
            revolutionized various fields through supervised, unsupervised, and
            reinforcement learning. Key algorithms include linear regression,
            decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. ML’s
            applications span from image and speech recognition to predictive
            analytics and recommendation systems. Despite its transformative
            potential, challenges like data quality, model interpretability, and
            overfitting remain. As technology advances, ML is poised to further
            impact industries and daily life.
